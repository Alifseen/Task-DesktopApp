# Task Desktop App

My First Desktop Graphical User Interface App.

This app lets the user define todo items, edit them, and mark them as complete. 

It has a live clock as well. 

I also learned how to use os module to create a file.

To create an executable file on windows (run in virtual environment) we can use pyinstaller and run command

```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --clean Task_gui_app.py
```
