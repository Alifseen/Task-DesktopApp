Uploading Repository:
After setting up git, we need to create a github account.
create a new repository, which is a project, name it a name related to project
To push your files to your github, go to git -> manage remote -> press plus icon -> add the repository link
commit "ctrl+K" is for git and push "ctrl+shift+K" is for github which uploads the latest version to github
Github gets all the files added in git repository

Downloading a repository:
You can either download a zip file of the repository manually by clicking on the green code button on the github's repository page and selecting "download zip", then extract them, open a new project and paste them there.
Or you can clone it in your pycharm IDE.
To clone it you need to have Git enabled, and from git menu select clone
Enter the url of the public repository that you get from clicking the code button and then copy button under HTTPS, then select the destination path (preferably an empty directory).
You will get an option to create a new virtual environment and install the modules mentioned in the requirement.txt file if any.
